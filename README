# Kurrent

Kurrent is an extensible markup language and document generation tool. At the
moment it is still experimental and may undergo drastic design changes.

The idea is to create a language that is easy to type, read, understand,
inspired by the simplicity of Markdown[1] and the extensibility of
reStructuredText[2].
